WARNING: This mod is planned to be player in EXPERT worlds, most of it's drops, spawns and recipes rely on EXPERT.
This mod add many fusions of accessories, a "Night's Edge", "Excalibur" and "Terra Blade" equivalent for most weapons types, and much more.

Advanced Tinkering is a mod created by me (TheKingAurum) to add a few things I would like to see in the game, and I'll explain all of them in categories:

Symbols: The initial focus of the mod, "Symbols" are a group of accessories fused into one, and after each boss you defeat, you can upgrade those symbols with more accessories that you can get after the said boss;
Void: This set of items include the "Night's Edge", "Dark Lance" and new weapons for all classes and armor, all of them made following the same steps of the sword. Unique colors for crimson or corruptions items used in the crafting;
Hallowed: Now you can make even more weapons for the 5 classes with "Hallowed Bars";
Heroicium: By dismantling the "Broken Hero Sword" in a heavy workbench or autohammer, you gain "Heroicium Dust" used to make bars, and then forge it into "Broken Hero" items to create "True" variants of Void and Hallowed items;
Terra: With a "True Void" and "True Hallowed" item in hand, you can fusion it in a respective "Terra" item, and the "Terra Armor" boosts the weapons efficacy;
Metals: There are new metals used for various crafting recipes of existing items and some new too, but the most useful ones are the alloys, made using dust of other metals and combinig them to melt in the furnace;
Summoner: Now you can gain the bonus of the 8 initial "Hardmode Ore" sets (Cobalt to Chlorophyte) and craft a exclusive headpiece to its class;
Thrower: Now you can gain the bonus of the 8 initial "Hardmode Ore" sets (Cobalt to Chlorophyte) and craft a exclusive headpiece to its class;
Gloves: Expanding this throwing weapon class, this mod add many gloves that uses throwing items as ammo and boosts them by adding a debuff or increasing the damage or critical chance;
Food: Another core of this mod is improved foods, that add three different buffs based on where you get the food and how you prepared it;
